#![no_main]

//! Cross-contract integration fuzz harness for ZizaLend.
//!
//! Individual per-contract fuzz harnesses (lending_pool_fuzz.rs,
//! loan_manager_fuzz.rs, remittance_nft_fuzz.rs, multisig_governance_fuzz.rs)
//! each exercise their own contract in isolation. This harness exercises
//! end-to-end user lifecycles across RemittanceNFT → LendingPool →
//! LoanManager so that system-wide invariants get exercised:
//!
//!   1. **Token Flow Conservation** — sum of tokens held by the pool, by
//!      depositors, and by borrowers must always equal the sum of tokens
//!      minted into the system. No protocol path can manufacture or destroy
//!      tokens.
//!
//!   2. **Score Consistency** — the LoanManager's view of a borrower's
//!      eligibility (gated on RemittanceNFT::get_score) must match the score
//!      the NFT contract reports. Score penalties routed through repayment,
//!      default, and seizure flows must exactly round-trip into the NFT.
//!
//! All contract panics are insulated through `try_invoke_contract` so that a
//! failure in any one action does not terminate the fuzzer (see
//! `contracts/fuzzing_article.md` §1).
