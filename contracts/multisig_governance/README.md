# ZizaLend Multisig Governance Contract

A multi-signature timelock governance contract for admin transfer of any ZizaLend protocol contract.

## Architecture

- **Propose → Approve → Finalize** workflow for admin transfers.
- **Timelock**: Minimum 24-hour delay before any transfer can be finalised.
- **Multi-sig quorum**: Configurable threshold of N-of-M signers must approve.
- **TTL expiry**: Proposals expire after 7 days if not finalised.
- **Cooldown**: 1-hour reproposal cooldown after cancellation prevents rapid re-proposals.
- **Emergency cancel**: Admin can forcefully cancel any active proposal.

## Workflow

```
1. Propose: Admin calls propose_admin_transfer(new_admin, signers, threshold, delay)
2. Approve: Each signer calls approve_transfer(signer)
3. Finalize: Anyone calls finalize_admin_transfer(caller) once:
   - Timelock elapsed (≥24h from proposal)
   - Threshold met (≥ approvals)
   - TTL not expired (<7 days)
```

## Key Invariants

1. **Timelock ≥ 24h**: `delay_seconds` must be ≥ `MIN_TIMELOCK_SECONDS` (86,400).
2. **Threshold ≤ signers**: Threshold cannot exceed the number of signers.
3. **Threshold ≥ 1**: Empty thresholds are rejected.
4. **Max 20 signers**: Prevents storage/gas abuse.
5. **No duplicate signers**: Explicitly enforced at proposal time.
6. **Single active proposal**: Only one `Active` proposal at a time.
7. **TTL = 7 days**: Proposals expire after `PROPOSAL_TTL_SECONDS` (604,800 seconds).
8. **Approvals are idempotent**: Duplicate calls from the same signer don't double-count.
9. **CEI pattern**: Cross-contract `set_admin` call happens *before* local state cleanup.
