# ZizaLend Remittance NFT Contract

A non-transferable (with cooldown) reputation NFT that tracks a borrower's credit score, remittance history, and collateral status on-chain.

## Architecture

- **Score-based reputation**: Each NFT stores a credit score (0–850) that gates loan eligibility in the LoanManager.
- **History tracking**: Score changes are recorded with ledger timestamps, capped at the 50 most recent entries.
- **Authorized minters**: Only the admin and explicitly authorised contracts (e.g., LoanManager) can mint/update scores.
- **Seized flag**: Marks a borrower's collateral as seized, blocking new loan requests but allowing repayment of existing debt.
- **Auto-burn on repeated default**: After `burn_threshold` defaults, the NFT is automatically burned.
- **Admin remint**: Burned accounts can be recovered only via admin-gated `admin_remint()` with a prior `approve_remint()`.
- **Transfer with cooldown**: NFTs can be transferred between wallets with a 17,280-ledger cooldown between transfers.

## Key Invariants

1. **Score bounds**: Score never exceeds `MAX_SCORE` (850) and is bounded at `MIN_CREDIT_SCORE` (300) on decrease.
2. **No duplicate mints**: An address can only hold one NFT at a time.
3. **Burned is terminal**: `mint()` rejects burned addresses — recovery requires the admin-only `admin_remint()` path.
4. **Remint is single-use**: Each `approve_remint()` is consumed on use and cannot be reused.
5. **Seized ≠ burned**: A seized borrower can still repay loans and clear their debt; seized is cleared on burn/transfer/remint.
6. **Transfer moves all state**: Metadata, score history, default count, and seized flag all move atomically to the destination.
7. **Minter cap**: Maximum 32 authorised minters.
